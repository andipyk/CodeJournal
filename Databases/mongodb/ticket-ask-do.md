Thanks for reaching out to DigitalOcean!

1. Your droplets appear to be Ubuntu 14.04, which should work just fine, I'm pretty sure per the original docs, that 3.6 still supports that Ubuntu version. 

2. Yes, you can do that.

3. There appear to be several GUI's available, including https://robomongo.org/ you'll have to do research based on your own needs. :) 

4. Here is a video install guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbweLu1cZvE as well as several other tutorials below:
