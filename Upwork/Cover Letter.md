Hello

I have reasonable experience to develop web app with Ruby on Rails at very reasonable rate, I also have experience in the following:

- MySQL, PostgreSQL, jQuery, React JS and some Angular JS, for build sites like: Site for Real Estate Agency, News Portal/Magazine, Online Shops, Database App, Warehouse and Corporate Sites.

- all site were done by me from 0. I got just PSD files and did all responsive HTML coding for MAC/Win: FF/Chrome/IE/Safari.

- I have great knowledge how develop well optimized DB and some NoSQL DB;

- I also have experience building website using Joomla & WordPress.

My previous employers always complimented me that I have good creative taste.

Based on my expertise I can recommend which framework template can be used to simplify cloning web site in future.

Here are some of my projects: pengembanganpelabuhan.com, cmpbatam.com, pencerahansejati.com, erabaru.net, codemedio.tk, widyobumi.com, vendorpernikahan.ga etc. Please note that all of them including creative navigation and tiles were done by me.
